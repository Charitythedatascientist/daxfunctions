creating a clculated column:
FilteredpriceColumn = 
    IF(
        Products[Discontinued] = TRUE() 
    && 
        Products[UnitPrice] < 20, 
        "Include","Exclude")


FilteredpriceColumn is the new column name
    Products is the table under consideration with columns:
        Discontinued and UnitPrice
    && is the AND 
    Include is assigned to the rows that meet the conditions. 
    Exclude is assigned to the rows that do not meet the conditions.

    You can replace the Inlcude and Exclude values with yes or no etc.

Creating a calculated measure
CountOfFilteredProducts = COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        Products, Products[Discontinued] = TRUE()
        && Products[UnitPrice] < 20
    )
)

The FILTER method filters the Products table and selects only rows where:
Products[Discontinued] is TRUE and Products[UnitPrice] < 20.
COUNTROWS then counts the number of rows where these conditions are true.
Note: the fiter function takes the Products table as the first arg
This tells the DAX to consider all rows in the Products table.
